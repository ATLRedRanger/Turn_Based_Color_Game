1) Spellbook
	-When I think of a spellbook I think:
	1) It holds spells
	2) It can hold multiple spells
	3) It's limited in scope. 
	4) What would make someone want to use a spellbook instead of a staff?
	5) Spellbooks can be generic
	6) Spellbooks only have so many pages
2) What makes a staff special?
	-When I think of a staff I think:
	1) Staves channel the power of spells
	2) Staves are usually specific
	3) You can use a staff to hit someone physically
3) Status Effects?
	1) Burn - A dot that deals damage based on % of total health
	2) How should I implement status effects? 
		-Pokemon style where there's a % chance to be afflicted
		-Souls style where you build up the status and then you are afflicted
4) Weapons?
	1) Weapons should feel different
	2) One thing I've implemented is that weapons can deal stamina damage
	   when defending. 
	3) Axes deal a little bit of stamina damage when the OP is defending
	4) Hammers deal a lot of stamina damage when the OP is defending
	5) I think I want swords to have 2 stances and their abilities be based
	   on those stances.
		-One stance can be offensive and the other defensive
	6) Why would someone want to use a bow over a spell?
		-What if bows were a stamina based weapon?
5) Stamina
	1) So far stamina only affects accuracy
	2) Stamina should affect critical hits
6) Items
	1) Health potions - Recovers an amount of health to the user
	2) Stamina potions - Recovers an amount of stamina to the user
	3) Color potions - Add more of a specific color to the mana pool
7) Armor
	1) Types of armor
		1) Head
		2) Chest
		3) Legs
		4) Arms 
	2) Armor should increase defensive values
	3) Armor could increase/decrease color in the environment
	4) Armor could affect stamina values
8) Enemies
	1) Enemies should have abilities based on the environment
	2) Should feel very different from one another
	3) Enemy identifiers:
		-Enemies having abilities based on their tier
		-Ex. Tier 1 enemies have only 1 ability, Tier 2 enemies have 2, etc. 
		-This way, when checking for enemy abilities I can make a switch statement using enemyTier as the switch and using 
		 their tiers as the cases to check for all of their abilities.
		-Boss would be the highest tier and it'll check for boss type abilities (like an additional attack before or after their regular attack or something)
9) Shared Mana
	1) What makes my game different is the shared mana pool
	2) What makes the shared mana pool different?
	3) What are the advantages and disadvantages of a shared mana pool?
	4) How does everything interact with this pool?
10) Art
	1) Setting- I want the setting to be a fantasy Namibia. Sand dunes in the background, mountains, ocean, etc. 
	          - A fantasy settign
		  - The weapons, buildings, etc is all driven by the idea that the sand is a viable source for glass
		  - So what would Namibia look like if the people of Africa could turn their desert sand into glass for everyday life?
		  - The weapons, containers, buildings, etc all made of glass or use it primarily.
		  - Would Namibians have built pyramids of glass? Domed buildings? etc.
	2) Art Style- I want the art style to be 2D, but Matt brought up a point that I could go 2.5 (3D backgrounds 
2D art) and I think that's something to take into consideration.
		    -Invader Zim art style
		    -Would like for it to be bright and vibrant.
	3) Monsters- Monsters are creations of light, but I don't know how much that should affect their appearance. 
		   - Some monsters have abilities that change their attributes or some other aspect depending on how much colored mana is available. I think this should be represented visually if possible. 
		   
		   - I think a skeleton could be kind of neat because you could put something visually interesting inside the chest cavity.
		   - I would like to take inspiration from DQ8 and how they decided to make visually distinct enemies. 
	    	   -Would also like to take inspiration from the natural wildlife of Namibia. 
			-White/Black rhinos, cheetahs, all the different variations of antelope, mongoose, antbear, honey badger, buffalo, wildebeest, pangolin, etc. 
			-Birds could be like the Red-necked spurfowl (using the coloration to know it'll be a red damage dealer or resistant enemy.
		   -Would like to take inspiration from the insects:
			Namib Desert Beetle, dragonflies, etc. 
		   -Maybe some skeletal-animal construct hybrids or something?
